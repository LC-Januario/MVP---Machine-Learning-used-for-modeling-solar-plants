# MVP---Machine-Learning-used-for-modeling-solar-plants
First prototype used for ilustrating my initial idea for my bachelor's thesis: implementation of machine learning models for development of meta-models for solar plants;

The code was made using python (pandas, scikitlearn) and used simulated data as its database;

The result consisted of 2 models with 80% accuracy in predicting solar fraction;
